        "explanation": "AWS Global Accelerator is designed to improve the availability and performance of applications by using static IP addresses (Anycast) and directing traffic over the AWS global network to optimal AWS endpoints. This is particularly beneficial for real-time applications. Amazon CloudFront is excellent for on-demand (cached) content delivery. For a mix of real-time and on-demand with a global audience, Global Accelerator can be a strong choice for the real-time component, often used in conjunction with CloudFront for the on-demand part. However, if only one service is chosen, Global Accelerator directly addresses the real-time aspect and can also improve on-demand if origins are AWS-based.",
