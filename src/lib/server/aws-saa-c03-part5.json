      "questionText": "A company wants to use the AWS Cloud to make an existing application highly available and resilient. The current version of the application resides in the company's data center. The application recently experienced data loss after a database server crashed because of an unexpected power outage. The company needs a solution that avoids any single points of failure. The solution must give the application the ability to scale to meet user demand. Which solution will meet these requirements?",
      "explanation": "This solution ensures high availability and resilience by deploying application servers in an Auto Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones. Using an Amazon RDS DB instance in a Multi-AZ configuration provides automatic database replication and failover, preventing data loss and eliminating single points of failure.",

      "questionText": "A company needs to ingest and handle large amounts of streaming data that its application generates. The application runs on Amazon EC2 instances and sends data to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams, which is configured with default settings. Every other day, the application consumes the data and writes the data to an Amazon S3 bucket for business intelligence (BI) processing. The company observes that Amazon S3 is not receiving all the data that the application sends to Kinesis Data Streams. What should a solutions architect do to resolve this issue?",
      "explanation": "The issue occurs because Kinesis Data Streams' default 24-hour data retention period is shorter than the application's 48-hour consumption cycle, causing data loss. Increasing the data retention period ensures all data remains available until processed.",
      "answers": [
        {
